How to run this program:

1. Open three terminal windows, and run the following three commands; one on each windows
    ./nEmulator <emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward (sender) direction> (Integer: Valid port number)
                <receiver's network address> (String: IP format or hostname format)
                <receiver's receiving UDP port number> (Integer: Valid port number)
                <emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward (receiver) direction> (Integer: Valid port number)
                <sender's network address> (String: IP format or hostname format)
                <sender's receiving UDP port number> (Integer: Valid port number)
                <maximum delay of the link in units of millisecond> (Integer: Non-negative)
                <packet discard probability> (Float: Non-negative between 0 and 1)  
                <verbose-mode> (Boolean: Set to 1, the network emulator will output its internal processing)
    py receiver.py <emulator's network address> (String: IP format or hostname format)
                   <emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward (receiver) direction> (Integer: Valid port number)
                   <receiver's receiving UDP port number> (Integer: Valid port number)
                   <output file> (String: File name)
    py sender.py <emulator's network address> (String: IP format or hostname format)
                 <emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward (sender) direction> (Integer: Valid port number)
                 <sender's receiving UDP port number> (Integer: Valid port number)
                 <timeout in milliseconds> (Integer: Non-negative)
                 <input file> (String: File name)
